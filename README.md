# Notes
Does not, at the moment, take into account work-reduction such as meetings and breaks. Proper planning is required to keep on track with the counter.

Requires, at the moment, lunch to occur before endtime. For halfday workhours, set lunch to start at end of day time, and Endtime at the end of lunch.
